version](https://badge.fury.io/js/graphql-import.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/graphql-import)\n\n\nImport &amp; export definitions in GraphQL SDL (also refered to as GraphQL modules)\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nyarn add graphql-import\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```ts\nimport { importSchema } from 'graphql-import'\nimport { makeExecutableSchema } from 'graphql-tools'\n\nconst typeDefs = importSchema('schema.graphql')\nconst resolvers = {}\n\nconst schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers })\n```\n\n## Example\n\nAssume the following directory structure:\n\n```\n.\n├── a.graphql\n├── b.graphql\n└── c.graphql\n```\n\n`a.graphql`\n\n```graphql\n# import B from \"b.graphql\"\n\ntype A {\n  # test 1\n  first: String\n  second: Float\n  b: B\n}\n```\n\n`b.graphql`\n\n```graphql\n# import C from 'c.graphql'\n\ntype B {\n  c: C\n  hello: String!\n}\n```\n\n`c.graphql`\n\n```graphql\ntype C {\n  id: ID!\n}\n```\n\nRunning `console.log(importSchema('a.graphql'))` procudes the following output:\n\n```graphql\ntype A {\n  first: String\n  second: Float\n  b: B\n}\n\ntype B {\n  c: C\n  hello: String!\n}\n\ntype C {\n  id: ID!\n}\n```\n\nPlease refer to [`src/index.test.ts`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-import/blob/master/src/index.test.ts) for more examples.\n\n## Development\n\nThe [implementation documentation](https://graphql-import.now.sh/) documents how things are implemented under the hood. You can also use the VSCode test setup to debug your code/tests.\n\n## Related topics & next steps\n\n- Static import step as build time\n- Namespaces\n- Support importing from HTTP endpoints (or [Links](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link))\n- Create RFC to add import syntax to GraphQL spec\n","maintainers":[{"email":"kim.brandwijk@gmail.com","name":"kbrandwijk"},{"email":"schickling.j@gmail.com","name":"schickling"},{"email":"tim.suchanek@gmail.com","name":"timsuchanek"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-02-27T09:19:54.690Z","created":"2017-11-22T13:30:43.754Z","0.1.0":"2017-11-22T13:30:43.754Z","0.1.1":"2017-11-22T13:51:45.376Z","0.1.2":"2017-11-22T14:04:13.171Z","0.1.3":"2017-11-22T15:09:11.410Z","0.1.4":"2017-12-04T19:00:22.276Z","0.1.5":"2017-12-07T14:32:55.281Z","0.1.6":"2017-12-19T09:14:48.939Z","0.1.7":"2017-12-19T16:16:03.241Z","0.1.8":"2017-12-19T19:18:53.565Z","0.1.9":"2017-12-29T13:41:50.167Z","0.2.0":"2018-01-04T20:24:12.540Z","0.2.1":"2018-01-05T18:55:16.895Z","0.3.0":"2018-01-06T00:35:31.775Z","0.3.1":"2018-01-06T17:50:20.309Z","0.4.0":"2018-01-12T20:56:09.959Z","0.4.1":"2018-01-15T17:40:47.425Z","0.4.2":"2018-01-30T15:53:17.054Z","0.4.3":"2018-02-07T19:50:13.652Z","0.4.4":"2018-02-23T21:53:47.462Z","0.4.5":"2018-02-27T09:19:54.150Z"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+ssh://git@github.com/graphcool/graphql-import.git"},"users":{"sergiodxa":true},"homepage":"https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-import#readme","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-import/issues"},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"5a9522ba-ce31\"","_lastModified":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 9:19:54 GMT"}
