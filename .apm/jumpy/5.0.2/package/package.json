Hit <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>\n2.  Choose from your presented labels:\n3.  Enter two characters.\n4.  Keep coding!\n\n[ ![Jumpy in Action! - (gif made with recordit.co)][1]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidLGoldberg/jumpy/master/_images/jumpy.gif)\n\n[1]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidLGoldberg/jumpy/master/_images/jumpy.gif\n\n## Install\nOn command line:\n```\napm install jumpy\n```\nor the for the whole jumpy suite:\n```\napm install jumpy jumpy-beacon back-jumpy\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n*   Works great with or without [vim-mode](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode \"vim-mode's Homepage\") or [vim-mode-plus](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode-plus \"vim-mode-plus's Homepage\")!\n  *   Vim modes supported:\n      *   command mode\n      *   insert mode\n      *   visual mode (expands selections with <kbd>v</kbd> or <kbd>V</kbd>)\n  *   Recommended key mappings to replace 'f' in vim-mode see 'Settings' below.\n\n## Key Bindings\n\n### Defaults\n\n*   Enter jump mode\n    *   <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>\n    _**NOTE:** This particular hotkey conflicts with the very awesome [Hydrogen package](https://nteract.io/atom).\n    Please rebind jump mode to something else or override it for Jumpy (see below)_\n*   Reset first character entered\n    *   <kbd>backspace</kbd>\n*   Cancel/exit jump mode (any)\n    *   <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>\n    *   <kbd>enter</kbd>\n    *   <kbd>esc</kbd>\n    *   <kbd>space</kbd>\n\n## Settings\n\n### Jumpy preferences\n\n( Preferences <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> ) -> search for 'jumpy'\n\n*   **Font Size**:\nIf set, must be a decimal value less than 1.\n*   **High Contrast**:\nIf checked, uses a more colorful and fun (usually green) label.\n*   **Match Pattern**:\nProvide a custom regex to match labels with.\n*   **Use Homing Beacon Effect On Jumps**:\nIf left on, will display a homing beacon (usually red) after all jumps.\n\n![Jumpy settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidLGoldberg/jumpy/master/_images/jumpy-settings.png)\n\n*Example*:\n\n![Jumpy example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidLGoldberg/jumpy/master/_images/jumpy-high-contrast-font-camel.png)\n\n(image after settings set to .85 font size, high contrast, and default camel case matching pattern)\n\n### 'vim-mode/vim-mode-plus' Users (Strongly Recommended Override)\n\nPut this override in your **'Atom'** -> **'Keymap...'** settings:\n\n    'atom-text-editor:not(.mini).vim-mode:not(.insert-mode):not(.jumpy-jump-mode), .tree-view':\n        'f': 'jumpy:toggle'\n\nor if `vim-mode-plus`:\n\n    'atom-text-editor:not(.mini).vim-mode-plus:not(.insert-mode):not(.jumpy-jump-mode), .tree-view':\n        'f': 'jumpy:toggle'\n\nThis will **bind 'f' to toggle Jumpy**.\n\nThis is not the default because it **changes vim's native behavior**.\nInstead, with Jumpy, after jumping to the nearest word, you can easily word or character jump over to your target.\nThe [Vimium chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en) chose this binding.\nPlease let me know what you think about this binding for Jumpy [here](https://discuss.atom.io/t/introducing-jumpy-new-package/10980/28)!\n\n### 'hydrogen' Users\nIf you want to use the original keybinding for Jumpy it's <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd>.  Hydrogen overrides this to simulate the Jupyter notebook behavior.\nPut this override in your **'Atom'** -> **'Keymap...'** settings:\n\n    'atom-workspace atom-text-editor:not(.mini)':\n        'shift-enter': 'jumpy:toggle'\n\n_This is less necessary for vim-mode users because of above binding, although setting up a binding like this will allow jumps from insert mode as well!_\n\n### Jumpy Styles\n\nNote: Styles can be overridden in **'Atom' -> 'Open Your Stylesheet'**\n(see examples below)\n\n```less\natom-text-editor {\n    .jumpy-label {\n        // Regular labels\n        background-color: black;\n        color: white;\n        &.high-contrast {\n            // High Contrast labels (activated in settings)\n            background-color: green;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## My other Atom packages :)\n\n*   [Jumpy-beacon](https://atom.io/packages/jumpy-beacon)\n*   [Back-jumpy](https://atom.io/packages/back-jumpy)\n*   [Qolor](https://atom.io/packages/qolor)\n\n## Keywords\n\n(A little SEO juice)\n\n*   Shortcuts\n*   Navigation\n*   Productivity\n*   Mouseless\n*   Plugin\n*   Extension\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/DavidLGoldberg/jumpy/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/DavidLGoldberg/jumpy#readme","_id":"jumpy@5.0.2","_shasum":"ab96bdade5cd6d3058d8b030f5d79dd235ddf75f","_resolved":"file:../d-118811-2557-8tczxy.3m4vtmlsor/package.tgz","_from":"../d-118811-2557-8tczxy.3m4vtmlsor/package.tgz"}
